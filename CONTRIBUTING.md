# Contributing to Our Project's SDK

We value your input and contributions! We use the [OpenAPI Generator tool](https://openapi-generator.tech) to generate our SDK based on an OpenAPI YAML specification.

If you find an issue with our SDK and want to contribute a fix, follow the guidelines mentioned below:

## Reporting an Issue

1. Notice an issue while using the SDK? Try to determine what's causing it. Was it a particular endpoint, operation, or datatype?

2. Check the YAML specification: Once you've identified the issue, refer to the corresponding definition in the OpenAPI YAML specification file that is included in the SDK. This could be a specific path, operation, parameter, or schema.

3. Describe the current behavior and desired correct behavior.

4. Describe the steps to reproduce this issue.

Please note that due to our open-source process, we don't have a direct way to accept code contributions for the SDK. The SDK is directly generated from our OpenAPI YAML specification file. Hence, you don't need to manually update the SDK. Instead, identify the modifications needed in the OpenAPI YAML specification.

## Submitting a Suggestion

If there's something in the SDK that isn't broken but could be better, you're welcome to share suggestions. Constructive feedback is always appreciated!

When submitting a suggestion:

1. Be clear and concise in your description of the suggestion.

2. Explain why it would be beneficial. Real-life examples, if applicable, can help to illustrate your point.

3. Be patient. Not all suggestions can be incorporated immediately, and it may be necessary for us to research your idea before we can implement it.

Remember, contributions come in many forms, not just in code! Identifying areas for improvement or bringing up issues helps us make the SDK better for everyone.

Thank you for your contributions!
